Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (e.g. lakes, rivers, oceans. aquifers and groundwater), very often by human activities.<br>
Water pollution occur when pollutants (particles, chemicals or substances that make water contaminated) are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without enough treatment to get rid of harmful compounds Pollutants get into water mainly by human causes or human factors, Water pollution can be a Point-source, Non Point-source, or Transboundary in nature.<br>
Any change or modification in the physical, chemical and biological properties of water that will have a detrimental consequence on living things is water pollution.<br>
The water pollution problem Water covers over 70% of the Earth’s surface. It ¡s a very important resource for people and the environment.<br>
Water s obviously crucial to human health The WHO advises that at least 7 5 liters per day per person are necessary to meet -the requirements of most people under most conditions” and
at least another 20 liters per day to cover basic hygienic needs.<br>
As long as humans live, water will be needed and consumed. This means humans are bound to create wastewater. It also means we will produce other non-water items and the disposal of
waste (metals and other liquids) from that process will affect fresh water and the environment in some way.<br>
Water pollution affects drinking water, rivers, lakes and oceans all over the world. In many developing countries, ills usually a leading cause of death, by people drinking from polluted water sources.<br></p> 	
<p align=left>There are different types of water pollution:<br><br>
<b>Nutrients Pollution</b></p>
Some wastewater (fertilizers and sewage contain high levels of nutrients. If they end up in water bodies, they encourage algae and weed growth in the water. This will make the water
undrinkable, and even clog filters. Too much algae will also use up all the oxygen in the water, and other water organisms in the water will die out of oxygen starvation.

<b>Surface water pollution</b>
<br><br>
Surface water includes natural water found on the earth’s surface like rivers lakes, lagoons and oceans, Hazardous substances coming into contact with this surface water, dissolving or
mixing physically with the water can be called surface water pollution.
<br><br>
<b>Oxygen Depleting</b><br><br>
Water bodies have micro-organisms. These include aerobic and anaerobic organisms When too much biodegradable matter (things that easily decay) end up in water, it encourages more
microorganism growth, and they use up more oxygen in the water. If oxygen is depleted aerobic organisms die, and anaerobic organisms grow more to produce harmful toxins such as
ammonia and sulfides.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Ground water pollution</b><br><br>
When humans apply pesticides and chemicals to soils, they are washed deep into the ground by rainwater. This gets to underground water, causing pollution underground.<br>
This means when we dig wells and bore holes to get water from underground it needs to be checked for ground water pollution.
