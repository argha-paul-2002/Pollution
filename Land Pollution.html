Land pollution is the deterioration (destruction) of the earth’s land surfaces, often directly or indirectly as a result of man’s activities and their misuse of land resources.<br>
It occurs when waste is not disposed of properly, or can occur when humans throw chemicals onto the soil in the form of pesticides, insecticides and fertilizers during agricultural practices.
Exploitation of minerals (mining activities) has also contributed to the destruction of the earth’s surface.<br></p>
<p align=left>There are different types of land pollution.<br></p>
<p align=left><b>Solid Waste</b></p>
These include all the various kinds of rubbish we make at home, school hospitals, market and workplaces. Things like paper, plastic containers, bottles cans, food and even used cars and broken electronic goods, broken furniture and hospital waste are all examples of solid waste. Some of these are biodegradable (meaning they easily rot or decay into organic matter).
Examples include food droppings, paper products as well as vegetation (like grass and twigs) others are not biodegradable, and they include plastics, metals and aluminum cans, broken computer and car parts.<br>
Because these do not easily decay they pile up in landfills (a place where all the city’s rubbish are sent),where they stay for thousands of years. These bring great harm to the land and people around it.

<b>Pesticides arid Fertilizers</b><br><br>
Many farming activities engage in the application of fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides for higher crop yield. This is good because we get more food. Sometimes, insects and small animals are killed and bigger animals that eat tiny animals (as in food chains) are also harmed. <br><br>
<b>Chemicals</b><br><br>
Chemical and nuclear power plants produce waste materials that have to be stored somewhere. Fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals manufacturers also produce lots of solid and liquid waste. In many cases, they are stored in an environmentally safe way, but there are some that find their way into landfills and other less safe storage facilities. Sometimes they also find their way into leaking pipes and gutters. They end up polluting soils and making crops harmful to our health.
