Air pollution (say: po-loo-shun) occurs when gases, dust particles, fumes (or smoke) or odour are introduced into the atmosphere in a way that makes it harmful to humans, animals and
plant This is because the air becomes dirty.
<br>
The Earth is surrounded by a blanket of air (made up of various gases) called the atmosphere. The atmosphere helps protect the Earth and allow life to exist. Without it we would be burned
by the intense heat of the sun during the day or frozen by the very low temperatures at night.
<br>
Any additional gas, particles or odours that are introduced into the air (either by nature or human activity) to distort this natural balance and cause harm to living things can be called air pollution.

<b>Emissions from industries and manufacturing activities</b></p>
Consider a typical manufacturing plant You will notice that there are long tubes (called chimneys) erected high into the air with lots of smoke and fumes coming out of it Waste incinerators,manufacturing industries and power plants emit high levels of carbon monoxide, organic compounds. and chemicals into the air. This happens almost everywhere that people live. Petroleum refineries also release lots of hydrocarbons into the air.

<b>Burning Fossil Fuels</b>
<br><br>
After the industrial age transportation has become a key part of our lives Cars and heavy-duty trucks, trains, shipping vessels and airplanes all burn lots of fossil fuels to work Emissions from automobile engines contain both primary and secondary pollutants. This is a major cause of pollution and one that is very difficult to manage. This is because humans rely heavily on vehicles and engines for transporting people, good and services.
<br><br>
Fumes from car exhausts contain dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulates. On their own, they cause great harm to people who breathe
them Additionally, they react with environmental gases to create further toxic gases.<br><br> <br>
<b>Household and Farming Chemicals</b><br><br>
Crop dusting, fumigating homes, household cleaning products or painting supplies, over the counter insect/pest killers, fertilizer dust emits harmful chemicals into the air and cause pollution.
In many cases, when we use these chemicals at home or offices with no or little ventilation, we may fall ill if we breathe them.
